CI Lab setup and Freestyle Cowsay
---------------------------------

Tip: Read the instructions twice and then draw your topology before you start to work on a project!

1. Lab setup:
   - Create a Jenkins image with docker client installed in it (this should be very simple).
   - Create your CI lab with `docker-compose`, with a Jenkins service and a GitLab service (you will administer your own instance of a "remote" git server). Make sure to setup volumes to store you Jenkins home directory, and any directories GitLab requires.
   - Expose Jenkins and GitLab ports to your machine.
   - Login to GitLab with its `root` user, and use it to setup two additional users (and their appropriate permissions):
     a. `<yourname>` - Which will represent (for the exercise) a standard "developer" user, or the development team.
     b. `jenkins` - To be used by the Jenkins server, in order to have access to GitLab.
   Tip: This lab will serve you in the upcoming weeks for multiple exercises (and the exam), so don't name it "cowsay"!
2. Cowsay - using a Freestyle job:
   - Create a repository and push Cowsay source code to GitLab.
   - Create a job that builds and tests cowsay:
   - Add build stage (`docker build`).
   - Add test stage (`docker run` and `curl`).
     Tip: Be mindful of the Docker networks in use!


To hand-in
----------
1. Your lab's `docker-compose.yaml`.
2. Your Jenkins' `Dockerfile`.
3. Your full topology drawing (including Cowsay's test container).
